📊 Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data Analysis (Capstone Project)
📌 Project Overview
This capstone project analyzes Fitbit fitness tracker data to identify user activity patterns, sleep quality, and calorie expenditure trends.
The goal is to generate data-driven insights that can help improve user engagement and inform product or wellness recommendations.
This project simulates a real-world business scenario where a data analyst supports health and fitness decision-making using wearable data.

🎯 Business Questions
•	How active are users on a daily and weekly basis?
•	Is there a relationship between steps taken and calories burned?
•	How efficient is users’ sleep, and how does it vary over time?
•	What trends can be observed in activity and sleep behavior?

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Key cleaning steps included:
•	Removing duplicate records
•	Handling missing and inconsistent values
•	Standardizing date formats
•	Verifying numeric data types
•	Separating combined columns (e.g., date and day of week)
________________________________________
📐 Key Calculations
•	Average daily steps
•	Average calories burned per day
•	Sleep efficiency
•	Sleep Efficiency = (Total Minutes Asleep / Total Minutes in Bed) × 100
•	7-day moving averages to identify trends
•	Trendlines and R² values to assess strength of relationships

📊 Analysis & Visualizations
The analysis focused on:
•	Daily and weekly activity trends
•	Relationship between steps and calories burned
•	Sleep efficiency over time
•	Identifying periods of higher and lower engagement
Visualizations were designed to be clear, interview-ready, and easy for non-technical stakeholders to interpret.

🔍 Key Insights
•	Users who consistently take more steps tend to burn more calories, showing a strong positive correlation
•	Activity levels fluctuate throughout the week, with noticeable peaks and dips
•	Sleep efficiency varies significantly between users and across days
•	Sustained activity (not just one-day spikes) is associated with better overall performance metrics
________________________________________
💡 Recommendations
•	Encourage users to maintain consistent daily activity rather than short bursts
•	Introduce sleep improvement prompts for users with low sleep efficiency
•	Use weekly trends to personalize fitness and wellness suggestions
•	Leverage activity consistency as a key engagement metric
________________________________________
🚀 Next Steps
•	Include a longer time range for stronger trend analysis
•	Integrate demographic data to improve personalization
•	Build a dashboard for real-time user insights
•	Apply predictive modeling to forecast activity and sleep patterns

📎 Project Deliverables
•	Cleaned datasets
•	SQL queries
•	Excel workbooks with calculations and charts
•	Visual analysis and documented insights
